Managing pages in Django CMS involves creating, organizing, and editing the structure and content of your website. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Accessing the Page Admin Interface:**
   Select "Pages..." in the page menu of the toolbar.

2. **Creating a New Page:**

   * Click on "Add Page" to create a new page.
   * Enter the page title, select the page type (if applicable), and define the URL and other settings.

3. **Organizing Page Hierarchy:**

   * Arrange the page hierarchy by creating parent-child relationships between pages.
   * Use drag-and-drop functionality to organize pages in a tree-like structure.

4. **Managing Page Content:**

   * Click on the settings icon of a page to access its settings
   * Click on the eye icon of a page to access its content.
   * Use placeholders to add content. Edit or add plugins (text, images, forms, etc.) into these placeholders.

5. **Editing Page Settings:**

   Adjust page settings such as metadata (SEO-related information like meta titles, descriptions, keywords), publication dates, permissions, etc.
6. **Preview and Publish:**

   * Preview the page to see how it will look to visitors.
   * Once satisfied, publish the page to make it live on the website.
7. **Managing Existing Pages:**

   To edit an existing page, navigate to the Pages section, locate the page, and click on its eye icon to access its  content.

Make necessary changes to the content, settings, or structure.

.. tip::
  **Permissions:** Adjust user permissions in Django CMS to control who can create, edit, or publish pages.

  **URL Handling:** Django CMS often handles URL routing automatically, but you can customize URLs and slugs within the page settings.

  **Versioning and Revisions:** Django CMS keeps track of page revisions, allowing you to revert to previous versions if needed.

Managing pages in Django CMS involves a mix of structural organization, content creation, and configuration adjustments. The system is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for content editors to manage the website's structure and content efficiently.
